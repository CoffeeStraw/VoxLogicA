### To compile for all supported plaforms, type "make release"
### To compile for a specific OS (e.g. linux) run "make release-OS" (e.g. "make release-linux"
### If you use make that way, you'll find executables in ../releases

### This makefile can only be run on macos and linux 
###
### This makefile is not actually needed to build the software; it's
### just a set of shortcuts.  To compile on a specific OS of which you
### know the RID, run:
###
### dotnet build -c release -r RID
###
### For instance, to compile for windows, run
### dotnet build win-x64
###
### Currently supported RIDs are linux-x64, osx-x64, win-x64
###
### the program will be compiled in
### ./bin/release/netcoreapp2.x/win-x64/publish/voxlogica

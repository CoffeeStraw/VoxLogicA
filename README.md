Hybrid CPU/GPU execution model
==============================


TODO: 

- garbage collection and pre-allocation of memory

- 3D support

- floating point computation

- carefully check load workflow (e.g. if one loads a 8bit or 16bit image, the result should not change)

- check what happens when loading multiple files

- switch to a better backend than CLoo

VoxLogicA: Voxel-based Logical Analyser
=======================================

VoxLogicA is a tool for analysing images using ImgQL specifications.

ImgQL is a language to analyse images, based on spatial logics. VoxLogicA
interprets ImgQL specifications using a model-checking approach, which entails,
in particular, heavy use of memoisation techniques to permit complex analyses in
short execution times, at the expense of used memory. Analysis is automatically
distributed to multiple CPU cores where possible, so that a VoxLogicA session is
typically faster than an equivalent hand-written computer program.

This branch contains a very preliminary version of VoxLogicA that operates on polyhedra.  Write to us for more information!

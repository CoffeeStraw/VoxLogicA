VoxLogicA-GPU: Voxel-based Logical Analyser in GPU
==================================================

This branch of VoxLogicA contains a reduced, experimental in-GPU version of VoxLogicA. To use it, you need to have opencl installed on your system, which is not yet covered by this README. To compile it, just check-out and type make release (or just release-linux, release-osx, release-win). By now, it has been tested only on linux.

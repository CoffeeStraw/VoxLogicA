This VoxLogicA branch is used to extract significant slices from a BraTS-like dataset for testing 2d analysis. Slices are preprocessed for normalization using the percentiles operation, and are upscaled. See the following paper for more details:

See Runme.sh (requires exactly one parameter, the name of a BraTS-like data directory, which WILL BE MODIFIED TO ADD NEW .png files).
